Trying to solve Advent of Code 2018.

I rarely ever use Python so I'm using this to try and brush up a bit, hence I'm probably not using all the appropriate/best constructs.
If you have any suggestions about stuff I could be doing better, feel free to open an issue up and tell me (I appreciate it) :)

Also I'm sort of optimising for solving solutions quickly, so I don't recommend using this code as an example of the best algorithms
and patterns to use.
